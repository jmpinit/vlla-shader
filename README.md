Some friends made the VLLA and then later I connected it to a Raspberry Pi
and wrote various pieces of software (like this project, and [1](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-gifs),
[2](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-cannon),
[3](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-dj),
[4](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-lua),
[5](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-demotime),
[6](https://github.com/jmpinit/vlla-js)) to create effects on it.
It used a library called [libvlla](https://github.com/jmpinit/libvlla) that I made
to pump the pixels out over two serial ports to Teensy boards which then shifted the
data out to the custom LED boards.

I worked on it in 2014 while I was in school.
